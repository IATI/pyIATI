markers =
    fixed_to_202: mark that a test only uses v2.02 data, and could possibly be updated in the future to either be version-agnostic or test a wider range of versions
    latest_version(version=None): mark a test as needing review when a new version of the IATI Standard is added. This will generally require adding a new input to the parameter list, and then updating the mark to reflect the change.
