class Dataset(object):
    """Representation of an IATI XML file that may be validated against a schema.

    Attributes:
        xml_str (str): A string representation of the XML being represented.
        xml_tree (ElementTree): A tree representation of the XML being represented.

    Note:
        The current content of the dataset is deemed to be that which was last asigned to either `self.xml_str` or `self.xml_tree`.

    Warning:
        The behaviour of simultaneous assignment to both `self.xml_str` and `self.xml_tree` is undefined.

        `xml_str` and `xml_tree` are not great names. They are also too tied together. It should be determined whether this close relationship is really desired.

        Does not fully hide the lxml internal workings.

    Todo:
        Implement getters and setters for attributes.

        Implement an addition override to allow for combation of datasets.

            It should be possible to create a dataset from a file. In this situation, having `xml` as a required parameter does not seem sensible. Need to better consider this situation.
