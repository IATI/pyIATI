"""A module containg a core representation of IATI Rulesets.

Note:
    Rulesets are under-implemented since it is expected that their implementation will be similar to that of Codelists, which is currently unstable. Once Codelist stability has been increased, Rulesets may be fully-implemented.

Warning:
    The contents of this module have not been implemented. Their structure may change when they are implemented.

Todo:
    Implement Rulesets (and Rules). Likely worth completing the Codelist implementation first since the two will be similar.
