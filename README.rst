iati.core
=========

The iati.core Python module.

|Build Status| |Requirements Status|

Varying between: |experimental| and |unstable| (see docstrings)

General Information
===================

This is a Python module containing IATI functionality that would
otherwise be replicated in many different locations by many different
software projects.

**The contents of this library is at best unstable, and much is
experimental**. As such, it must be expected that its contents and API
will change over the short-to-medium term future. ``Warning`` sections
in docstrings help flag up some particular known stability concerns.
``Todo`` sections describe known missing or incorrect features.

**Feedback, suggestions, use-case descriptions, bug reports and so on
are much appreciated** - it's far better to know of issues earlier in
the development cycle. Please use `Github
Issues <https://github.com/IATI/iati.core/issues>`__ for this.

At present the library (``core``) represents the contents of the `IATI
Single Source of Truth
(SSOT) <https://github.com/iati/iati-standard-ssot>`__. It is able to
handle a single version of the Standard (2.02 by default, although it is
possible to change data files). Some placeholder work has been
undertaken to deal with multiple standard versions. It is planned that
this work will be completed once surrounding APIs are nearer a stable
state.

More pleasant API naming, better hiding of underlying ``lxml``, full
documentation, improved error handling, and a greater number of tests
for edge-cases are known key areas for improvement.

It is planned that different sections of the library, such as
``validate`` are split into their own repositories. They exist within
this repository at present to help speed up the iteration process.

General Installation for System Use
===================================

.. code:: shell

    # install software dependencies
    apt-get install python-pip libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev

    # install this package
    python setup.py install

Documentation
=============

At present, an HTML documentation site can be generated using the
following commands:

.. code:: shell

    # to build the documentation
    sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source/ iati/
    sphinx-build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/

The file ``docs/build/index.html`` serves as the documentation home
page.

Usage
=====

**WARNING:** This ``iati.core`` library is currently in active
development. **All usage examples are subject to change**, as we
iteratively improve functionality. Therefore, the following examples are
provided for illustrative purposes only. As the library matures, this
message and other documentation will be updated accordingly!

Once installed, the library provides functionality to represent IATI
Schemas, Codelists and publisher datasets as Python objects. The IATI
Standard schemas and codelists are provided out of the box, however this
can be manipulated if bespoke versions of the Schemas/Codelists are
required.

Loading an XSD Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of default IATI ``.xsd`` schema files are included as part of
the library. They are stored in the folder:
``iati.core/iati/core/resources/schemas/202/``

The following example loads the default IATI v2.02
``iati-activities-schema.xsd`` schema:

.. code:: python

    import iati.core.default
    schema = iati.core.default.schema('iati-activities-schema')

Helper functions will be written in due course to return all xpaths
within a schema, as well as documentation for each element.

Loading codelists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A given IATI codelist can be added to the schema. Example using the
`Country <http://iatistandard.org/codelists/Country/>`__ codelist.

.. code:: python

    import iati.core.default
    schema.codelists.add(iati.core.default.codelist('Country'))

The default collection of IATI codelists can be added using:

.. code:: python

    import iati.core.default
    for codelist in iati.core.default.codelists().values():
        schema.codelists.add(codelist)

Loading Rulesets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default IATI Ruleset can be loaded by using:

::

    import iati.core.default

    iati.core.default.ruleset()

If you wish to load your own Ruleset you can do this using:

::

    import iati.core.resources
    import iati.core.Rulesets

    ruleset_str = iati.core.resources.load_as_string(filepath)
    # To create a Ruleset object from your ruleset_str:
    iati.core.Ruleset(ruleset_str)

**Note:** This functionality is not yet implemented.

Validate an IATI Dataset against the Standard Ruleset:

To be added.

Working with IATI datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loading a dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import iati.core.data

    # Load a local file
    with open('path/to/iati-activites.xml', 'r') as xml_file_object:
        dataset_as_string = xml_file_object.read()

    # Load a remote file
    # Assumes the Requests library is installed: http://docs.python-requests.org/
    import requests
    dataset_as_string = requests.get('http://XML_FILE_URL_HERE').text

    dataset = iati.core.Dataset(dataset_as_string)

Accessing data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Dataset`` object contains an ``xml_tree`` attribute (itself an
``lxml.etree`` object). `XPath
expessions <https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp>`__ can be
used to extract desired information from the dataset. For example:

.. code:: python

    # WARNING: The following examples assume the source dataset file is produced in IATI v2.x format

    # Show the activities contained within the dataset
    > dataset.xml_tree.xpath('iati-activity')
    [<Element iati-activity at 0x2c5a5f0>, <Element iati-activity at 0x2c5ac68>, <Element iati-activity at 0x2c5acf8>, <Element iati-activity at 0x2c5ad40>]

    # Show the title for each project
    > dataset.xml_tree.xpath('iati-activity/title/narrative/text()')
    ['\nIMPROVING MATERNAL HEALTH AND REDUCING CHILD MORTALITY THROUGH DEVELOPING HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THE POOR AND MARGINALISED COMMUNITY OF BAGHBANAN, NORTH WEST PAKISTAN\n', '\nIMPROVING MATERNAL HEALTH AND REDUCING CHILD MORTALITY THROUGH DEVELOPING HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THE POOR AND MARGINALISED COMMUNITY OF BAGHBANAN, NORTH WEST PAKISTAN\n', '\nImproving maternal health and reducing child mortality through developing health service delivery for the poor and marginalised community in Baghbanan, North West Pakistan\n', '\nIMPROVED HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY IN NORTH WEST PAKISTAN (\n']

    # For the first activity only, show the planned start date (i.e. activity date type = 2)
    > dataset.xml_tree.xpath('iati-activity[1]/activity-date[@type=2]/@iso-date')
    ['2014-01-01']

Python Version Support
======================

This code supports Python 2.7 and 3.4+. We advise use of Python 3.5 (or
above) as these versions of the language provide some rather useful
features that will likely be integrated into this codebase.
